## 🏢 Project Overview
This repository contains the detailed **Electrical Design and Cost Estimation** for a G+10 high-rise residential building. The project simulates a real-world consultancy workflow, covering the entire design lifecycle from initial load estimation to final schematic drafting and tendering (BoQ).

The design ensures compliance with **National Building Code (NBC)** and **IEC Standards** for safety, efficiency, and reliability.

## ⚡ Key Technical Deliverables

### 1. Load Estimation & Power Planning
* **Load Analysis:** Calculated Total Connected Load (TCL) and applied standard diversity factors to derive Maximum Demand (MD).
* **Transformer Sizing:** Selected distribution transformer rating based on MD + 20% safety margin for future expansion.
* **DG Set Sizing:** Calculated required kVA for backup Diesel Generators considering critical and essential loads (Lifts, Fire Pumps, Common Lighting).

### 2. Electrical Distribution System (SLD)
* Designed the **Single Line Diagram (SLD)** depicting the hierarchy:
  * **HT Side:** 11kV Supply -> Metering Cubicle -> VCB.
  * **Transformation:** 11kV/415V Step-down Transformer.
  * **LT Side:** Main PCC -> APFC Panel -> Floor Distribution Panels.
* **Protection Coordination:** Specified switchgear ratings (ACB, MCCB, MCB) and cable sizing based on current capacity and permissible voltage drop.

### 3. Cost Estimation (BoQ)
* Prepared a comprehensive **Bill of Quantities** for tendering.
* Scope includes Earth work, Cabling (Armored Al/Cu), Distribution Boards, Earthing Stations, and Lightning Protection Systems.

## 🛠️ Tools & Standards Used
* **AutoCAD:** For drafting Single Line Diagrams (SLD) and Floor Layouts.
* **Microsoft Excel:** For dynamic load schedules and BoQ calculations.
* **Standards:** * **NBC 2016:** National Building Code of India (Electrical Services).
  * **IEC 60364:** Low-voltage electrical installations.
