## 🛠️ Design Methodology



### 1️⃣ Load Calculation (Excel)

- Calculated connected load for lighting, power, HVAC, lifts, pumps, EV charging, and fire services.

- Applied diversity & demand factors as per **NBC 2016 (Part 8)**.

- Finalized transformer and DG capacities based on maximum demand.



### 2️⃣ System Design (AutoCAD)

- Developed **Single Line Diagram (SLD)** from transformer to floor distribution.

- Implemented **mechanical interlock** between Grid & DG supply.

- Designed **typical floor layout** showing metering and flat-level distribution.



### 3️⃣ Cost Estimation (BoQ)

- Prepared a detailed Bill of Quantities.

- Estimated costs for transformer, panels, cables, busbar trunking, and earthing using market rates.
